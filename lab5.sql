SELECT * FROM inventory;

#1

SELECT COUNT(*) AS number_of_copies
FROM inventory
WHERE film_id = 
	(SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title = 'Hunchback Impossible');

#2
#SELECT AVG(length) FROM film;
SELECT film_id, title, length
FROM film
WHERE length >=  (SELECT AVG(length) FROM film);

#3
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM actor
WHERE actor_id IN (
    SELECT actor_id
    FROM film_actor
    WHERE film_id = (SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title = 'AloneÂ Trip')
);

## Bonus:
# 4. Sales have been lagging among young families, and you want to target family movies for a promotion. Identify all movies categorized as family films.

SELECT film.title
FROM film
JOIN film_category ON film.film_id = film_category.film_id
JOIN category ON film_category.category_id = category.category_id
WHERE category.name = 'Family';

# 5. Retrieve the name and email of customers from Canada using both subqueries and joins. To use joins, you will need to identify the relevant tables and their primary and foreign keys.

SELECT customer.first_name, customer.last_name, customer.email
FROM customer
WHERE customer.address_id IN (
    SELECT address.address_id
    FROM address
    WHERE address.city_id IN (
        SELECT city.city_id
        FROM city
        WHERE city.country_id = (
            SELECT country.country_id
            FROM country
            WHERE country.country = 'Canada'
        )
    )
);

SELECT customer.first_name, customer.last_name, customer.email
FROM customer
JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
JOIN city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
WHERE country.country = 'Canada';

# 6. Determine which films were starred by the most prolific actor in the Sakila database. A prolific actor is defined as the actor who has acted in the most number of films. First, you will need to find the most prolific actor and then use that actor_id to find the different films that he or she starred in.

SELECT film.title
FROM film
JOIN film_actor ON film.film_id = film_actor.film_id
WHERE film_actor.actor_id = (
    SELECT actor_id
    FROM (
        SELECT actor_id, 
			   COUNT(*) AS Film_Count
        FROM film_actor
        GROUP BY actor_id
        ORDER BY Film_Count DESC
        LIMIT 1
    ) AS subquery
);

# 7. Find the films rented by the most profitable customer in the Sakila database. You can use the customer and payment tables to find the most profitable customer, i.e., the customer who has made the largest sum of payments.

SELECT film.title
FROM film
JOIN inventory ON film.film_id = inventory.film_id
JOIN rental ON inventory.inventory_id = rental.inventory_id
WHERE rental.customer_id = (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM (
        SELECT customer_id, 
			   SUM(amount) AS Total_Amount
        FROM payment
        GROUP BY customer_id
        ORDER BY Total_Amount DESC
        LIMIT 1
    ) AS subquery
);

# 8. Retrieve the client_id and the total_amount_spent of those clients who spent more than the average of the total_amount spent by each client. You can use subqueries to accomplish this.

SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS Total_Amount_Spent
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > (
    SELECT AVG(total_amount)
    FROM (
        SELECT SUM(amount) AS Total_Amount
        FROM payment
        GROUP BY customer_id
    ) AS subquery
);
